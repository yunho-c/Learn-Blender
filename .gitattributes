# Git Attributes for Media and Blender Projects
# ------------------------------------------------
# This file helps Git manage different file types more effectively,
# especially for projects with large binary assets. It uses Git LFS
# (Large File Storage) for media and Blender files to keep the core
# repository size small and fast.

# Tell Git to use LF line endings for text files to maintain consistency
# across different operating systems.
* text=auto eol=lf

# === Blender Files ===
# Treat .blend files as binary files and track them with Git LFS.
# The `diff=blender` attribute can be paired with a custom diff tool
# configured in your .gitconfig to show changes between versions.

*.blend1 filter=lfs diff=blender merge=binary -text
*.blend2 filter=lfs diff=blender merge=binary -text

# Lock .blend files to prevent merge conflicts on binary assets.
# This is useful for teams where only one person should edit a file at a time.
# To use this, your Git LFS server must support file locking.

# Auto-generated backup and junk files from Blender.
# These are typically ignored in a .gitignore file, but you can
# explicitly mark them as binary here if needed for any reason.
